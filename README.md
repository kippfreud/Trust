..todo:

work on better 
- interactions
- interaction strategies
- interaction handlers
- voting strategies

Incorporate traits

Incorporate the reaction phase (contestants react to votes and update their internal nets)

Endgame condition
Ties in voting - what happens?

Question: How different are true and estimated social networks?

We need to make agents: 
- observe interactions
- learn from evictions
- gossiping

todo:
1. gossiping
2. measuring graph distance
3. Think about graph edge weights, uncertainty, prize pool vs utility?
3. voting strat which uses percieved network (e.g. defensive trust vote)
4. interaction handling

agents are learning to map graphs into utility -> they will choose the 
action that maximizes their utility
